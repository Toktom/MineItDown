# MineItDown

A small game inspired by the Goblin Miner minigame from Capybara Go!

This is my first mini-project using **Odin**, alongside **Raylib**, created as part of my journey to learn the language. I used GitHub Copilot to assist me when I got stuck or needed help refactoring the code. The goal was to create a simple game to practice and improve my programming skills.


The assets for the game were made by me, using **Libresprite**. The atlas was generated using the **Texture Packer** plugin made for VS code.

Thank you for checking out my project! Feel free to copy it and play around with it.

For playing the game you will need to build the game by yourself. Build the game with the following:
` path_to_odin/odin.exe run path_to_src_folder/src/ -out:path_to_bin_folder/bin/main.exe`

Then add copy the `atlas.json` and `atlas.png` from `assets/` to the bin folder.
